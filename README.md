## üì¶ Installation

Start by installing the required components, then copy the configuration files into your `~/.config` directory.

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd repository
```

### 1. Themes and Icons

Install the GTK theme and icon set from the following sources:

- üé® [Gruvbox GTK Theme](https://github.com/Fausto-Korpsvart/Gruvbox-GTK-Theme)  
- üß© [Papirus Icon Theme](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme)  
- üóÇÔ∏è [Gruvbox Papirus Folder Icons](https://github.com/xelser/gruvbox-papirus-folders)

Once downloaded, or by extracting the files from my `gtk-3.0` and `gtk-4.0` folders, place them into your `~/.config` directory. Make sure to check which version of GNOME you have; some versions may only require placing the files in the `.theme` and `.icons` folders, but others may require placing them in `gtk-4.0` for proper functionality. Full instructions are available [here](https://github.com/Fausto-Korpsvart/Gruvbox-GTK-Theme).

### 2. Terminal Setup

For the terminal, you can install **Warp** from the official website:

```bash
# Download Warp from the official site: https://warp.dev/linux

# Go to the folder where the .deb file was downloaded
cd ~/Downloads

# Install the .deb file (replace the name if it's different)
sudo dpkg -i warp-terminal.deb

# Fix dependencies if necessary
sudo apt-get install -f

# Alternatively, use the install script
curl https://warp.dev/install.sh | bash
```

And paste my config in the **Warp File**

### 3. GNOME Extensions

To use the extensions I‚Äôve configured, install the GNOME Extensions application, then add the following extensions:

- Blur my Shell
- Color Picker
- Just Perfection
- Media Controls
- Open Bar
- Panel Note

### 4. GNOME Extensions Config

I configured them on my own the way I like, I still don't know how to share my extension configurations with others, but as soon as I figure it out, I'll update it in my repo.

### 5. FastFetch set up

First you have to download fastfetch on your terminal, Fastfetch official site [Here](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch)

Once you have installed FastFetch, download the FastFetch folder from my dotfiles and replace your folder with mine to have my configuration.
